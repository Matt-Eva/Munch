# Munch
Munch is a frontend application that enables users to browse and search different recipes by ingredient, style, and name. Munch is built with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.

## Launch

To run Munch locally, you'll need to use json-server. Munch fetches data from <a href="https://www.themealdb.com/">theMealDb</a> and mimics persistence using a db.json file in conjunction with json-server.

If you don't already have json-server installed, you can install it by running `npm install -g json-server`.

After you've forked and cloned down this repository, run `json-server watch --db.json` to mimic API functionality. 

You can then open the application in your browser by running `open index.html`.
