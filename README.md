# Munch
Munch is a frontend application that enables users to browse and search different recipes by ingredient, style, and name. Munch is built with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.

## Launch

To run Munch locally, you'll need to use json-server. Munch fetches data from <a href="https://www.themealdb.com/">theMealDb</a> and mimics persistence using a db.json file in conjunction with json-server.
